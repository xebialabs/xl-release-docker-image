= XL Docker images for XL Release

This repository contains the source code for three flavors of Docker images for XL Release:

* The regular image, which is based on Debian (slim) Linux flavor  of the https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk/[OpenJDK base image]
1. An alternative image, which is based on the https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk/[CentOS 7 base image] and has OpenJDK 1.8 installed
1. The Red Hat-certified image, which is based on the registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7/rhel-atomic[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic 7 base image] and has OpenJDK 1.8 installed

This document only describes how to build these images. For user documentation, please refer to the following pages from the XebiaLabs documentation site:

= Building and publishing the images

Before building an image, download the right version of the server ZIP for XL Release from https://dist.xebialabs.com[the XebiaLabs distribution site] and put it in the `resources` directory. For example, to build the image for XL Release 8.1.0, put the file called `xl-release-8.1.0-server.zip` in the `resources` directory.
